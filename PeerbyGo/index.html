          <h2>About PeerbyGo</h2>
          <p>PeerbyGo is a Dutch company which gives people the opportunity to rent products from people who live closeby. On their website you can search for a product and rent it, PeerbyGo will take care of the delivery to the renter and back to the provider. These rents can also be called transactions for simplicity. At the moment PeerbyGo is mainly active in city's like Amsterdam, Utrecht and Rotterdam. Citys provide a large costumer potential compared to smaller villages, so city's are their main focus.</p>

          <h2>About the visualisation</h2>
          <p>For PeerbyGo it is interesting to see how many transaction have occured in a certain time period. Also it is interesting if particulair categories of product have been populair. The barchart and piechart take care of this information, they give a overview of the amount of transaction which have occured and show to which categories these transactions belong. Next to this information the location of the transactions is usefull as well. Using the map in visualisation it is possible to see if the transactions are equally distributed over the city. This will also indicate if certain area's don't have a lot of transaction which can be a case of concern.</p>
